# TypeScript Fixes for UI Components

This package contains fixed UI components for your Facebook Contest App with proper TypeScript type definitions.

## What Was Fixed

The original UI components had TypeScript errors related to implicit 'any' types in event handlers:
```
Failed to compile.
./ui_files/contests/page.tsx:40:30
Type error: Parameter 'e' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

I've fixed these errors by:
1. Adding proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
2. Adding explicit type annotations for all event handlers
3. Adding type definitions for all state variables
4. Importing the necessary types from React (ChangeEvent, FormEvent, etc.)

## Files Included

1. `contests/page.tsx` - Fixed with proper TypeScript types
2. `facebook-connect/page.tsx` - Fixed with proper TypeScript types
3. `process-comments/page.tsx` - Fixed with proper TypeScript types

## What to Expect

After applying these fixes, your application should build successfully without any TypeScript errors. The UI functionality remains exactly the same, but the code is now properly typed according to TypeScript standards.
